Multiple page website to convey a story, with interactive visualisation, a graph of data values, a description of the analysis, a link to the source data, and a short explanation of the project. The website should pull data from a database linked to a server side component. Analysis results may be pre-processed and results recorded in the database.

<h3>Exploratory, ‘storytelling’ nature of analysis description 20% </h3>
The work satisfies the brief to create an analysis driven visualisation. The report documents the process well and conveys the overall methodology carried out by the group. The technical aspects of the work is well formed and the visualisation details the story and the insight into the work. The work is good and some interesting analysis is performed which yields some interesting results. The work would need some work to publish the work online but would provide some interesting insights into the data set analysed.
  
**MUST DOS:** website page that gives an overview: project aim, outline  methodology (cleaning, clustering and text analysis), description of the source data. 

**WILL ADD MARKS:** visualisation that help describe the data source (python preprocessing of original dataset stats, with results stored on server and pulled into graphs)

**MINOR:**

<h3>Use of advanced data analysis methods to explore dataset 30% </h3>
The work shows good knowledge of the chosen topic although there may be some minor issues with the choice of data and/or methods at the lower end of the scale. At the upper end of the scale, matching data and/or method to the problem is sound. Some evidence of critical reflection is displayed.
  
**MUST DOS:** write up of clustering method chosen. Advantage over others. Why dimensions chosen (and how normalisation occurred, although irrelevant if one dimesion)

**WILL ADD MARKS:** multi-dimensional clustering in time as well as classification.

**MINOR:** 

<h3>Use of compelling and appropriate visualisation methods 30%</h3>
Figures and diagrams are overall good and well chosen, but at the lower end of the scale may contain minor errors. Visuals show students contributions but are lacking in clarity.
  
**MUST DOS:** tying in the tool we have made into the clustering process. 

**WILL ADD MARKS:** charts of the clustering process

**MINOR:** 


<h3>Design and aesthetics of website design 20%</h3>
The design and aesthetics of the website are good and the students have made use of various themes and open source libraries sourced from the presented material within lectures. A user would not struggle to use the website and some thought has gone into the flow and layout of the website. The group have made an conceited effort to use open source libraries, frameworks, and Stylesheets to fit the problem being solved.The website could be published on the internet with some updates to the narrative, visualisation or some minor corrections within the text of the website.
  
**MUST DOS:** 

**WILL ADD MARKS:** use bootstrap to define an overall theme

**MINOR:**
