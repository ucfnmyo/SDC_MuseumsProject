The cleaned data is stored in several tables in a MYSQL database, accessible through a node.js API. The key endpoints deliver a summary or a subset of the data according to parameters passed with a GET request. For several of the visualizations, custom endpoints were built to deliver exactly the data necessary, reducing load times and the complexity required of the code receiving the data. Documentation for the general API endpoints can be found <a href="http://dev.spatialdatacapture.org:8872/">here</a>.
