<<<<<<< HEAD
          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET) of New York City is the third most visited art museum in the world, having 6,953,927 annual visitors, as well as being the largest art museum in the United States. The MET’s Open Access program allows users to view the collection digitally. In addition, anyone can download the collection dataset and manipulate it without any copyright restrictions. The public domain is automatically updated as the MET digitizes artworks.</p>
        <h3 >The Dataset</h3>
          <p>The museum’s dataset presents over 490,000 art objects, distributed through over 5,000 years of art around the world.</p>

          <p>The Metropolitan Museum of Art (MET), of New York City, collections contain artwork from all around the world spanning over 5,000 years. It is the third most visited art museum in the world, having 6,953,927 annual visitors, as well as being the largest art museum in the United States. Its permanent collection contains over two million works of art.</p>
        <h3 >The Dataset</h3>
          <p>The MET’s Open Access program allows users to view the collection digitally. The museum’s dataset presents over 490,000 art objects with 44 attribute fields describing the artwork. The data is publicly available through the Metropolitan Museum <a href="https://github.com/metmuseum/openaccess">Open Access Github repo</a>. Documentation for the API that serves this data to the site is available <a href="http://dev.spatialdatacapture.org:8872/">here</a>. Images are provided through the <a href="https://metmuseum.github.io/"> Met Museum Collection API</a>. </p>
        <h3 >Project aims</h3>
          <p>An ineractive tool allowing the general public to engage with the Met collection. Using data mining techniques, this explores an alternative taxonomy of artworks, challenging traditional concepts of how we interact with art by taking a look at the materials used in MET collection, and exploring how a material and method used in one country has influenced artwork made by similar materials and methods in other countries throughout history.

        <h3>Data Cleaning</h3>
          <p>
            The first challenge was to have as many artworks associated to the country it was made in. Before cleaning the data, the MET dataset ‘country’ column contained inconsistent values (only ~76,000 objects had a country filled in the field) and the rest were null. In order to spatially visualize the collection, the ‘country’ column values must match with a country geojson values. The first step was to remove any string characters and any key fields that were not associated to the name of a country. For the remaining artworks with null values, we filled this in using the country associated to the artist’s nationality, artist’s display bio, or the culture (<a href="https://github.com/ryanabest/ms1-2018/blob/master/quant/MetObjectsExploration.py">ryanabest</a>). This resulted in dropping slightly more than 10% of the total objects to spatially visualize ~430,000 art objects. The next challenge was to associate each art object to the method and materials used to make the object. This involved refining the ‘classification’ column, which contained a term describing the artwork type (i.e. sculpture, painting) from 1,144 classifications into a generalized list of 205 classifications. To send the data in the correct format to MySQL, blank values were replaced with NaNs from numpy, which corresponds as null in MySQL.
          </p>
        <h3>Transformation</h3>
          <p>With a technique known as one-hot encoding we vectorized materials, methods and classifications to tranform the dataset into a machine-readable format, enabling advanced data analytics.</p>
        <h3>Back End</h3>
          <p>
              The cleaned data is stored in several tables in a MYSQL database, accessible through a node.js API. The key endpoints deliver a summary or a subset of the data according to parameters passed with a GET request. For several of the visualizations, custom endpoints were built to deliver exactly the data necessary, reducing load times and the complexity required of the code receiving the data. Documentation for the general API endpoints can be found <a target="_blank" href="http:dev.spatialdatacapture.org:8872/">here</a>.

      <h3> Medium Data </h3>
<<<<<<< HEAD
        <p> Natural language processing (NLP) was implemented to obtain material and technique keywords from artwork medium data.

        <h3> Artwork Classification </h3>
        <p>
=======
        <p> Natural language processing (NLP) was implemented to obtain material and technique keywords from artwork medium data. Keyword extraction vectorized the data according to the material or technique employed in the artwork.</p>
        <p>   <br>Understanding how certain materials and techniques were employed within artworks throughout time and space was the primary interest of this analysis. A challenge was that medium data contained inconsistent formatting and concatenated strings that prevented sufficient categorical groupings. To illustrate, a medium description can be “Belleek porcelain, with overglaze enamel decoration and gilding”. In this situation, desired materials would be ‘porcelain’ and ‘enamel’ (nouns), while techniques would involve be ‘overglaze’ and ‘gilding’ (verbs). </br>
          </p>

        <h3> Artwork Classification </h3>
          <p>The classification field contained a general term describing the artwork type (e.g. paintings, sculptures). Our challenge was a lack of generalised categories covering a wide range of artworks, to illustrate, where artworks were classified as ‘Membranophone-single-headed / frame drum’ and ‘Membranophone-single-headed / kettle drum’ should be agglomerated into one category: ‘membranophone’. Our approach in achieving this involved POS tagging with TextBlob, a Natural Language Processing Library, to extract noun phrases from the text data, these fed into a keyword extraction function by flashtext, which enabled us to extract relevant artwork categories from the data. Resultanty, we refined 1,114 classifications into 205 artwork categories. With such a result we can group similar artworks in a comprehensive and efficient manner.</p>

    <h3 class="w3-center">Clustering Analysis</h3>
    <div class="w3-row-padding w3-center" style="margin-top:30px">
        <p>We are clustering by two numerical variables, the artwork age and the location, and three categorical variables, the classification given by the MET and our extracted keywords for materials and method.

            This may seem a straight-forward task, but there are three important aspects of our dataset:
<<<<<<< HEAD

          <ol>
            <li> We don't know how many clusters to expect; the clusters are likely to vary greatly in size; and there will be points that don't naturally form a cluster. This rules out k-means clustering and leans towards a density based approach such as DBSCAN.</li>

            <li>  But we are also dealing with BIG DATA, at over 400,000 records. Processes such as DBSCAN that depend on pairwise distance comparisons naturally scale quadratically.</li>

          <li>  As an additional complication, our categorical variables have a very large number of categories; furthermore not all records have a single value in each category - there are records with no information for the category AND there are records which have multiple category values e.g. the artwork has been produced using more than one material. </li>
        </ol>
          <h3 class="w3-center">Spatio-Temporal Analysis</h3>
          <p>  Temporal data was incorported with the object begin date, since it defines an artistic reaction to a historical event. The Gower distance function enabled us to normalise annual dates that would fit in well with DBSCAN euclidean distance function.

            A similar problem comes into our notion of distance. For this we are using the centroids of the countries, processed using QGIS, and we can work directly with the latitude and longitude to calculate an accurate distance between points. In order to get round this we decided to convert the coordinates to a projection, which allows us to make use of the standard DBSCAN distance function. We used the Lambart Conformal Conic projection. Its advantages are that straight-lines in the projection equate to great-circles, the shortest path between two points, and it minimises the distortion of distance in the northern hemisphere, which is where the majority of the artwork is from.
